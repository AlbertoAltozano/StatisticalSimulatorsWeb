# STATIO: Teaching Simulators for Statistics and Operations Research
This simulator is part of [STATIO](https://statio.webs.upv.es), the Educational Innovation and Improvement Project (PIME/25-26/562) developed by the DEIOAC–[Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es).

# Description
This Shiny app helps you explore and understand a data sample using four complementary views:

* Histogram
* Boxplot
* Normal probability plot
* Basic sample statistics

By combining visualizations with numerical summaries (mean, median, dispersion, skewness, kurtosis, etc.), the app provides a clear and complete understanding of the data distribution.
